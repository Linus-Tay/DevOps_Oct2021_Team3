# **Development Operations - Team 3**
This following README file give you more insight into our development and processes carried out for the development of the game 'Simp City'.

## Project Background
The project is essentially a city-building strategy game is played over 16 turns. In each turn, you will build one of two randomly-selected buildings in your 4x4 city. In the first turn, you can build anywhere in the city. In subsequent turns, you can only build on squares that are connected to existing buildings. The other building that you did not build is discarded.

Each building scores in a different way and the objective of the game is to build a city that scores you as many points as possible.
